# Dell S2425H - Mac M1 - Fast Forward Issue

I recently bought a **Dell S2425H (23.8"/60.45 cm FHD IPS 100 Hz)**. It’s a pretty good display, and the speaker quality is also nice.  

I connected it via the **HDMI port**. After a few days, I noticed a strange issue:  

When I opened a YouTube video in Chrome, it got stuck. After closer observation, I realized the video was playing at tremendous speed, skipping straight to the end.  

I tried the same in Safari, but the issue persisted. I also tested with Twitter videos, and they wouldn’t play at all.

## Resolution

### 1. Use Built-in Speakers
- Go to **Settings > Sound > Output > Change to MacBook Air**.  
- This resolved the issue, but the audio output comes from the MacBook instead of the monitor.  

### 2. Use Monitor Speakers
- Plug in the HDMI cable **before starting the Mac**, not after it has booted.  
- Then restart the Mac.  
- This worked for me.
